It's the year 2222 and Goblins have invaded Earth.
The Goblins' goal is overthrow humans and rule the Earth.
The Humans must defend themselves with any items they can find to defeat the Goblins.
Humans and Goblins will take turns occupying the spaces on the map.
Humans and Goblins can only move one space per round.
Humans can move around the map using directional keys 'n', 's', 'e', and 'w',
which correlate to up, down, right, and left, respectfully.
Goblins only want to fight so each turn they will automatically move towards the closest Human.
Goblins are also scavengers and will pick up any items they find on the map. These items are of no direct
benefit to the goblins but they will pick them up just so that the Humans can't use them.

In the event that a Human defeats a Goblin, two things will happen:
1. The Goblin will drop all of their loot and the Human will have the opportunity to collect what they want
from the pile and add them to their inventory.
2. The Human's mental strength attribute will increase, which will improve their chances of surviving their
subsequent battles.

If a Goblin defeats a Human, two things will happen:
1. The Goblin will receive the Human's entire inventory.
2. The Goblin's aggression will increase, which will improve their chances of surviving their subsequent battles.

When a Human and Goblin are on the same space they will enter combat.
The player with the higher stats will have a higher chance at surviving the attack, but having
better stats DOES NOT guarantee victory, so be wise in your battles.
When two or more players of the same type occupy the same space, they will heal each other.
When two or more Humans are healing, their mental strength will increase as well.
When two or more Goblins are healing, their aggression will also increase.
When healing, players are more vulnerable so all will be defeated if attacked.

The first team to defeat every member of the other team will win and have total control of Earth.
Good luck.
