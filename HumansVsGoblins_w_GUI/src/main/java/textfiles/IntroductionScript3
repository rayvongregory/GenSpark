When a Human and Goblin are on the same space they will enter combat.
The player with the higher stats will have a higher chance at surviving the attack,
but having better stats DOES NOT guarantee victory, so be wise in your battles.
When two or more players of the same type occupy the same space, they will heal each other.
When two or more Humans are healing, their mental strength will increase as well.
When two or more Goblins are healing, their aggression will also increase.
When healing, players are more vulnerable so all will be defeated if attacked.

The first team to defeat every member of the other team will win and have total control of Earth.
Good luck.
