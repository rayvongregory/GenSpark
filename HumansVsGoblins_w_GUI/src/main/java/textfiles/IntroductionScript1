It's the year 2222 and Goblins have invaded Earth.
The Goblins' goal is overthrow humans and rule the Earth.
The Humans must defend themselves with any items they can find to defeat the Goblins.
Humans and Goblins will take turns occupying the spaces on the map.
Humans and Goblins can only move one space per round.
Humans can move around the map using the arrow keys ( ⮝  ⮟  ⮜  ⮞ ).
Goblins only want to fight so each turn they will automatically move towards the closest Human.
Goblins are also scavengers and will pick up any items they find on the map.
These items are of no direct benefit to the goblins but they will pick them up just so that the Humans can't use them.
